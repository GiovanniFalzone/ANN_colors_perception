# Neural Network for evaluation of differences between colors

We developed a Neural Network for recognition of differences between color patches in Industrial Printing. Using MATLAB Deep Learning toolbox, we created each network, with its dataset to test and train it. We've also created a MATLAB GUI to work on the network and see and compaire the results.

Due to the conference paper published by IEEE, we cannot share the source code, but more information are available in our report.

## IEEE Conference Paper
Recently, IEEE published a conference-paper, written by University of Pisa, about the work we developed.\
Here is the link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489306

Unfortunately we are not considered as author of the paper but we have a mention inside it.
